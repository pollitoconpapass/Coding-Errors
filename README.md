# Coding Errors 👾👽

Programming is beautiful. You can feel the power of creating great applications from scratch, feeling proud while showing your projects to other developers, or liking the thoughts of other people when they hear you are a programmer (except for the ‘can you fix my…’ no one likes those). 

However, all of that can blow away with a simple press on ‘Compile’ and… there appears some red underlined code.  
That’s why I decided to make this little pamphlet. Here I will document all the errors I had during my (hopefully long) programming career with their respectives solutions or ‘what you can do’ to solve it. 

I hope you like it and in some way it helps you to erase that stressed expression on your face. 😛
